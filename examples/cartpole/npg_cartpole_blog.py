Learning cart-pole with a policy network and value network.
The policy network learns the actions to take, and the value network learns
the expected reward from a given state, for use in calculating the advantage
function.
The value network is updated with a 2 norm loss * .5 without the sqrt on the
difference from the calculated expected cost. The value network is used to
calculated the advantage function at each point in time.
The policy network is updated by calculating the natural policy gradient and
advantage function, with a learning rate calculated to normalize the KL
divergence of the policy network output. This works to prevent any parameter
updates from drastically changing behaviour of the system.
